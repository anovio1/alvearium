    <h2>Menu</h2>
    <span>To interact with most of the mod, simply type "menu". This will open up a menu and will be the large majority of how to interact with the mod.</span>

    <span>Here, you can change your Race or Class, view spells you can cast (after you spawn at least once), see what classes and races other people are playing with Player Info, see the available commands, and have some additional help.

    You have to be dead to change your Race or Class. All experience is saved on the class, which means your "Human Fighter" will the same level as your "Elf Fighter", but not the same level as your "Human Wizard."</span>

    <h2>Dice</h2>
    <span>A lot of times, you'll see an ability does "3d8". This is the amount of damage it deals. Three separate dice are rolled, each having 8 sides (1-8). 10d8 would be ten dice rolled instead. To find the average damage an ability would do, take the lowest roll possible (10 for 10d8), add the highest amount possible (10 + 80 = 90), then divide by 2 for 45.</span>

    <h2>Abilities</h2>
    <span>When you spawn, you'll see more information about what you're playing. All Classes and Races have unique abilities. For instance, I'm a Level 1 Human Fighter. When I spawn, I'll see this:</span>

    <span>A lot of the time, these will be passive bonuses you always get. However, if it starts with !cast {ability} then that is a spell.</span>

    <h2>Spells and Binding</h2>
    <span>To use spells, you need to bind them to a key to cast. To do this, you'll need to enable your console.</span>

    <span>
    Now, you can open the console. Press "~" (its next to the 1 key) to open and close it.

    If I were a Sorcerer and I wanted to use the Fireball spell, I would type bind {key} "!cast Fireball" Then, I would look at the spot I want to cast it at and press the key. Here's an example of me binding it to my mouse side button. Unlike in previous additions, all spells need to be closed in quotes.

    <span>Many spells like Magic Missile need a target to cast at. Simply point your crosshairs over an enemy and then press your bind key. Some occur where you're looking (like Fireball). Others don't need anything at all (Greater Invisibility).</span>
    <span>Some spells have what is called a "save". There are six stats in D&D - Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom. When a spell has a save, a dice roll is made (20 sided dice). If a class has a good save (a good Dexterity save, for example), then they will add a bonus to this die roll. If the result is greater than the Spell save (usually 11 + a bonus that increases with the casters level), then it mitigates the spell's effect. This only occurs for spells with negative effects. For example, a successful Dexterity save will reduce the damage of a Fireball by half. Some spells simply won't have their effect work at all if the target passes the save.</span>

    <h2>Other Effects</h2>
    <span>All classes have a 5% chance to Critically Strike. If this occurs, the damage dealt will be doubled. Once Rogues reach a high enough level, they become immune and take normal damage. Fighter's gain an increased chance to Critically Strike.</span>
